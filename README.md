# esanders_AWS_DevOpsTheHardWay
Recreating my repository for my DevOps the Hard Way project, as was unable to get the original to sync after applying terraform changes which I could not find a fix for. Now have recreated and will wait until I've finished the files before committing any terraform changes to ensure I have the files in place.

01/06/2023 - Recreated repository and updated ReadMe, migrated Terraform files over from local save, created .gitignore file
           - Original files successfully committed, created new branches and continued with AdminTurnedDevOps DevOps The Hard Way guide
